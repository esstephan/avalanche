Make political phone calls easier by finding an online partner

# Summary

Phone calls to elected representatives are far more effective than online petitions, but picking up the phone can be intimidating, especially as a first-timer. Avalanche is an app in development that I will be blogging step by step in detail. Ultimately, it will let you find an accountability partner who is available during times you specify, and send a video chat appointment to connect with that person online. With your partner looking on and supporting you, you'll each make your calls in real time. Ten minutes and mission accomplished!
