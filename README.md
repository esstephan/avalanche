Make political phone calls easier by finding an online partner

# Summary

Phone calls to elected representatives are far more effective than online petitions, but picking up the phone can be intimidating, especially as a first-timer. PhoneFriend lets you find an accountability partner who is available during times you specify, and sends you a video chat link to connect with that person online. With your partner looking on and supporting you, you'll each make your calls in real time. Ten minutes and mission accomplished!

# Problem

# Solution

It's easier with a friend.

# How to Get Started

It's easy to get started. Just enter your name, email, and the time windows that work for you to make calls. When we find a match, you'll be emailed your partner's first name, a video chat link, and an appointment time that fits your schedule. Your personal contact information is never shared with anyone. 

# Customer Quote

"I'd never contacted my member of Congress before because I didn't know what to say. With my partner Janna on the line, I was able to make my first call to speak up about women's rights. It was so much easier than I thought!" - Gail Smith, Schenectady, NY
